### what tt does

Every 5 seconds:

- AppleScript queries the apple music app for the currently playing song.
- if changed, it fetches album artwork using the iTunes Search API.
- it then updates your discord status using `discord-rpc`.

---

### how it works

- **AppleScript**: Used to read song metadata from apple music.
- **Node.js + Discord RPC**: Sends presence updates to discord via IPC transport.
- **iTunes API**: (Optional) grabs high-res album art for visual polish.

---

### planned improvements (maybe)

- auto-thumbnail uploading to a CDN and serving it dynamically
- windows support via iTunes COM automation
- richer button integrations (e.g., direct link to current song)
